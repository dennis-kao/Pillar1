An Android wireframe for a medication intake tracking application our team built for a Software Engineering class, CIS*3750.
This app was developed for an assisited living group, Community Living Cambridge. The application needed to remind users to take their
medication on time, develop a sense of community and notify care givers of a client's intake status.

The current app demonstrates the following features:

- Logging in
- Adding a medication
- Removing a medication
- A schedule page
- A community page
